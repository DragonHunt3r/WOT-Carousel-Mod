# WOT-Carousel-Mod
A World of Tanks mod for configurable tank carousel row count

A small mod to allow players to have more than two rows of tanks in the tank carousel, because some users have a lot of tanks (like me).

This mod was made for World of Tanks version `1.12.0.0`. It is likely to be compatible with future game versions because it is such a small mod, but this is not guaranteed.

### Usage
The `carousel_mod.wotmod` file is a compiled version of the mod. Put this in the `/mods/<version>` directory in your World of Tanks installation folder.
The amount of rows can be configured in the `/mods/configs/SPCarousel/config.json` file.
